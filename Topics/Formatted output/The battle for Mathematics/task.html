<h2>The battle for Mathematics</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<p></p><p>A mysterious number known as the "PI number" has been discovered on the planet Mathematics. The inhabitants of the planet are afraid of its endless digits, which never end. It is up to you to round this number and bring harmony back to the planet Mathematics. Your task is to set the accuracy of the variable <code class="java">pi</code> to three decimal places and output the result. We highly recommend that you use <code class="java">printf</code> or <code class="java">format</code> to get more practice.</p><br><b>Sample Input:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight"></code></pre><br><b>Sample Output:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">3.142</code></pre><br><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 5 seconds</font><br><br>
